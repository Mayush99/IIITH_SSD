In the css file I have the two boxes for two divisions where the drag and drop will work.
I have function to validate form and event handlers for drag and drop events in .js file.
My html page. if given incorrect inputs will show alert message because it is validating the details first and then if the deatils are wrong it will show which attribute is incorrect.
