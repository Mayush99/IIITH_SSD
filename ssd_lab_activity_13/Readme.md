I have completed question 1 and 2 from assignment.
I have configured SQLite as a database connection. I have also creted server.py python script where i have configred user authentication for signup where user will register, signin where user will login and sign out where user will logout.
I have created end points for different routes for different authentication functions. My program will run on local host "127.0.0.1" and it will start execution from login function i.e. "127.0.0.1/user/signin".
