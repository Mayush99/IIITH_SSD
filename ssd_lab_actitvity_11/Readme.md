SSD_LAB_ACTIVITY_11

I have a file named "input.cs" which is my input csv file given in the lab. I have used the file and then read it. After reading it I have created one file where I have stored the data I get after deleting first 6 columns and then checking the condition that negative % change of more than 3% using filter and and lambda function.
Then reading the above file I have truncated the whole file and then created one list containing all the open, high, low values whose average I have calculated and then write into the file with line separated 3 values.
For iv question I have read the input.csv file which i have used to run the condition after taking input and checked that the input character is same as the first character of first column in file and then i checked that negative % change of more than 3% and stored it into stock_output.txt
